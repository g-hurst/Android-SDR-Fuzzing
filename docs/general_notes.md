# General Notes

### Fork of srsRAN
In order to make some changes in the srsRAN project, a fork was made
[g-hurst/srsRAN_Project](https://github.com/g-hurst/srsRAN_Project)

One thing to note here is that there is only one change that has been made:
modifying the gnb docker container command. However, this may also be able
to be fixed by overriding the yml with the overrides file in the docker
folder of our project.
